            <p> As a queer woman of color, my identity remains as the venerable and vulnerable
              reminders of who I am, how far I have become, and who I will become.
              advocating for the queer community has not only been a personal responsibility
              of mine, but given me alot of pride. below are a few work of social justice campaign
              and articles that has been pivotal to my advocacy for the queer community

            <p> As a hopeful designer interested in all things products and the digital design landscape,
              representation and visibility within the products is incredibly important to me.
              The importance of visibility should not only be practiced on shelves and in screen, but also
              behind and that means creation and development of designs from those that are usually underrepresented.
              In reflection to the luckyxlove campaign, I wrote an article for GLAAD's amp channel reflecting
              upon my design experience and the confidence designing a shirt for lucky brand has
              given be as a queer person </p>

            <p> For GLAAD's 2020 Spirit Day Against LGBTQ+ Youth bullying, I
              created digital website campaign fully funded by Squarespace
              thanks to their Make My Space contest that serves as an interactive,
              informative, and creative means of advocating and make a statement
              against LGBTQ+ youth bullying. The campaign allows for LGBTQ+
              folks and allies to speak out by contributing towards our online mural and
              gallery in purple spirit. LGBTQ+ youth deserve to be loved, to be accepted, and be
              surrounded by a community of enduring support for them to live and love as
              who they are, so no LGBT youth is left behind

            <div class="title">nyc 50th world pride march</div>
            <p> For my second pride march, I had an amazing time marching with
              GLAAD for the 50th anniversary of pride back home in NYC. It was
              an incredibly welcoming and exciting time for me to be in an accepting
              space of not only celebrating the strides we made, but most importantly,
              remembering that pride is a protest. We must honor the folks
              and continue to work & uplift marginalzied communities. The work that trans
              activists have done to create a space for queer workers of all industries,
              queer youth of color, queer activists, homeless queer folks, and every queer
              person in between will not be forgotten. Trans activist Sylvia’s legacy and
              the intersectionality of Marsha’s black transgender experience - for example -
              must be remembered, shared, amplified, and honored.
              Centering our work around trans rights gives trans folks the space to take
              back the radical movement they started.
              There is no queer liberation without trans liberation. NYC Pride is a reminder of
              the long road we have ahead of us and the work we have to do to ensure LGBTQ+ acceptance
              all around </p>
